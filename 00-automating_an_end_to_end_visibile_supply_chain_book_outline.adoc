= CHAPTER 1 - Supply Chain Logistics Overview

== Overview
The Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals defines logistics as “part of the supply chain process that plans, implements and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverses flow and storage of goods, services and related information between the point of origin and the point of consumption in order to meet customer’s requirements.”
The main objective behind the logistics process is to ensure that the customer receives the correct product, at the correct time, at the correct location, of the correct quality, with the correct documentation, with the correct authorization at the correct price. This process can be further divided into inbound logistics and outbound logistics.
Inbound logistics covers all functions related to procuring materials and then handling, storing and transporting them. Outbound logistics covers all functions related to the collection, maintenance and distribution of goods to the customer. 
****
Logistics refers to the movement, storage, and flow of goods, services and information inside and outside the organization.
